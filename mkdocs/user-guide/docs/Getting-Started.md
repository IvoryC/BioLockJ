## Installation and test


### Basic installation

The basic installation assumes you have java 1.8+ and a unix-like environment. 

Linux or MacOS command line is suitable.<br>If using Windows, see [Windows setup](Getting-Started-Windows) to setup a suitable environment.

Some features assume a bash shell, see [Notes about environments](../Supported-Environments).

#### 1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/BioLockJ-Dev-Team/BioLockJ/releases/latest) & unpack the tarball.
```bash
tar -zxf BioLockJ-v*.tar.gz
```
Save the folder wherever you like to keep executables.

**If** you choose to download the source code rather than the pre-compiled project, you will need to compile it by running `ant` with the `build.xml` file in the `resources` folder. 

#### 2. Run the install script 
The `install` script determines the location/name of the user profile, and appends it to define $BLJ and $BLJ_PROJ,  add the BioLockJ script folder to the path, and create a convenient alias called "cd-blj".

```bash
cd BioLockJ
./install
#     Saved backup:  /users/joe/.bash_profile~
#     Saved profile:  /users/joe/.bash_profile
# BioLockJ installation complete!
```

**Recommended:**  View your profile.  If there are older lines for earlier BioLockJ installations, remove those lines.

**Recommended:**  Edit your profile, and set the value of BLJ_PROJ to a convenient folder that you can find easily.  Your BioLockJ pipelines will be saved under this directory.

Start a new session so these additions take effect.

```bash
exit # exit and start a new session
```

Start a new bash session and verify that `biolockj` is on your `$PATH`.  A new terminal window or a fresh log in will start a new session.

```bash
biolockj --version
biolockj --help
```

#### 3. Run the test pipeline
```bash
echo $BLJ
# /path/to/BioLockJ
biolockj ${BLJ}/templates/myFirstPipeline/myFirstPipeline.properties

# Initializing BioLockJ..
# Building pipeline:  /Users/joe/apps/BioLockJ/pipelines/myFirstPipeline_2020Jan17
# cd-blj       -> Move to pipeline output directory
# Fetching pipeline status 
# 
# Pipeline is complete.
```
Notice the use of the `$BLJ` variable. This variable is created by the installation process; it points to the BioLockJ folder.

The myFirstPipeline project is the first in the tutorial series designed to introduce new users to the layout of a BioLockJ pipeline.

You should take a moment to [review your first pipeline](../Getting-Started#review-your-first-pipeline).


### Docker installation

This install runs the launch process on your host machine, and the main program and all modules are run in docker. To run even the launch process in docker, see [Working in Pure Docker](Pure-Docker.md).

#### 1. Install docker
See the current instructions for installing docker on your system: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
<br>You'll need to be able to run the docker hello world example:

```bash
docker run hello-world

# Hello from Docker!
# This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

```

#### 2. Download and install BioLockj

Follow the download and install steps in the [Basic Installation](../Getting-Started#Basic-Installation) download and install instructions.

#### 3. Run the test pipeline _in docker_

When you run the program, you will see a pop-up window asking for permission to share specific files. Say yes.<br>
If that does not appear, see [why doesn't my pipeline run in docker](../FAQ/#question-why-doesnt-my-pipeline-run-in-docker).

```bash
biolockj --docker ${BLJ}/templates/myFirstPipeline/myFirstPipeline.properties
# 
# Docker container id: 336259e7d3b8d9ab2fa71202258b562664be1bf9645d503a790ae5e9da15ce97
# Initializing BioLockJ..
# Building pipeline:  /Users/joe/apps/BioLockJ/pipelines/myFirstPipeline_2020Jan17
# Fetching pipeline status 
# 
# Pipeline is complete.
```

You should take a moment to [review your first pipeline](../Getting-Started#review-your-first-pipeline).

### Cluster installation

Installing BioLockJ on a cluster follows the same process as the [Basic Installation](../Getting-Started#Basic-Installation).  EACH USER must run the `install` script in order to run the BioLockJ launch scripts.  Use the property `pipeline.env=cluster` in your pipeline configuration to take advantage of parallel computing through the cluster.


## Review your first pipeline

The variable `$BLJ_PROJ` points to your projects folder. See a list of all of the pipelines in your projects folder.  
```bash
ls $BLJ_PROJ
```
By default, `$BLJ_PROJ` is set to the "pipelines" folder in BioLockJ (`$BLJ/pipelines`).  To change this, add a line to your bash_profile (or equivalent file): `export BLJ_PROJ=/path/to/my/projects`.  

Look at your most recent pipeline:
```bash
cd-blj
```

This folder represents the analysis pipeline that you launched when you called `biolockj` on the file _${BLJ}/templates/myFirstPipeline/myFirstPipeline.properties_.

Notice that the original configuration ("config") file has been copied to this folder. Review the config file that was used to launch this pipeline:
```bash
cat myFirstPipeline.properties
```

Notice that modules are specified in the config using the keyword `#BioModule`.  Each module in the pipeline creates a folder in the pipeline directory.  Notice that an additional module "00_ImportMetaData" was added automatically.

At the top level of the pipeline we see an empty **flag** file "biolockjComplete" which indicates that the pipeline finished successfully. While the pipeline is still in progress, the flag is "biolockjStarted"; and if the pipeline stops due to an error, the flag is "biolockjFailed".

The `summary.txt` file is a summary of each module as it ran during pipeline execution.  This is the best place to start when reviewing a pipeline.

The file `"MASTER_myFirstPipeline_<DATE>.properties"` is the complete list of all properties used during this pipeline.  This includes properties that were set in the primary config file ("myFirstPipeline.properties"), and properties that are set as defaults in the BioLockJ program, and properties that are set in user-supplied default config files, which are specified in the primary config file using the `pipeline.defaultProps=` property.  This "MASTER_*.properties" file contains all of the settings required to reproduce this pipeline.  

If the pipeline was run using docker, a file named `dockerInfo.json` will show the container information.

The pipeline log file `"myFirstPipeline_<DATE>.log"` is an excellent resource for troubleshooting.

The `validation` has tables recording the MD5 sum for each output from each module.  If the pipeline is run again, this folder can be used to determine if the results in the new run are an exact match for this run.

Within each module's folder, we see the "biolockjComplete" flag (the same flags are used in modules and at the top level).  All output-producing modules have a subfolder called `output`.  Most modules also have folders `script` and `temp`.  The output folder is used as input to down-stream modules.  Modules are the building blocks of pipelines.  For more information about modules, see [Built-in BioModules](Built-in-modules.md).



## Making your own pipeline
Now that you have a working example, you can make your own pipeline.  
You may want to modify the example above, or look at others under `/templates`.

Things are seldom perfect the first time.  Its safe to assume you will make iterative changes to your pipeline configuration.  BioLockJ offers some tools to facilitate this process.

 * Check your pipeline using [precheck](Check-Dependencies.md) mode 

 * Add modules onto your partial pipeline using [restart](Failure-Recovery.md)

 * Look through the base set of [modules](Built-in-modules.md) and even [create your own](Building-Modules.md)

A recommended practice is to make a subset of your data, and use that to develop your pipeline. 


##  Installing multiple versions on a single machine

You may want to have multiple versions of BioLockJ on the same machine.

Create a folder to hold all versions, suggested name: `BioLockJ_versions`.

In that folder, download and unpack the latest version of BioLockJ.  This creates a folder called "BioLockJ".  Rename that folder to include the version name (recommended: match the name of the downloaded file), for example: `mv BioLockJ BioLockJ-v1.3.13` .  

Create a symbolic link:
```
ln -s /full/path/to/BioLockJ_versions/BioLockJ-v1.3.13 current
```

cd into the "current" folder, and run the install script.  This will set the `$BLJ` variable in your profile to point to the this link.

Download and unpack another release of BioLockJ in the BioLockJ_versions folder, repeating the process from above.

Now you have two versions of BioLockJ,  a `BLJ` variable in your profile that points to a `current` symbolic link.  On systems with multiple users, an administrator should control the "group default" version by controlling the `current` link, and individual users can change their `BLJ` variable to point to the current group default or to a specific version.  On single-user systems, you can edit a link or the variable, whichever is more convenient.

All new versions of BioLockJ should be installed in the same `BioLockJ_versions` folder, in the same way.  


## Other notes for starting out

**Install any/all software [Dependencies](../Dependencies) required by the modules you wish to include in your pipeline.**

BioLockJ is a pipeline manager, designed to integrate and manage external tools.  These external tools are not packaged into the BioLockJ program.  BioLockJ must run in an environment where these other tools have been installed **OR** run through docker using the docker images that have the tools installed.  The core program, and all modules packaged with it, have corresponding docker images.

BioLockJ will shut down appropriately on its own when a pipeline either completes or fails.  _Sometimes_, it is necessary to shut down the program pre-maturely. See the [FAQ page](../FAQ) for more details.
